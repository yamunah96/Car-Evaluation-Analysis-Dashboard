# **🚗 Car Evaluation Dashboard**  

## **📌 Introduction**  
Welcome! This **Car Evaluation Dashboard** provides a **data-driven analysis** of car acceptability based on key factors:  
✔ **Safety**  
✔ **Maintenance Cost**  
✔ **Number of Doors**  
✔ **Passenger Capacity**  
✔ **Luggage Space**  

The dataset used is from the **UCI Car Evaluation Repository**, which categorizes cars into four acceptability levels:  
- **Unacceptable (unacc)**  
- **Acceptable (acc)**  
- **Good (good)**  
- **Very Good (vgood)**  

This dashboard helps **manufacturers, dealerships, and customers** identify patterns in car classification, aiding in **better decision-making**.

## **📊 Dashboard Breakdown & Key Insights**  

### **1️⃣ Count of Index by Class (Pie Chart)**  
📌 **Overview of car acceptability distribution:**  
- **70% of cars** are classified as **"Unacceptable"**, indicating **strict evaluation criteria**.  
- A **small percentage qualify as "Good" or "Very Good."**  
💡 **Insight:** Manufacturers can use this to understand how many cars meet consumer expectations.  

---

### **2️⃣ Car Acceptability by Safety (Bar Chart)**  
📌 **Safety plays a crucial role in acceptability:**  
- **High safety ratings (high, very high) = More Acceptable Cars.**  
- **Low safety ratings = Mostly Unacceptable Cars.**  
🚀 **Takeaway:** **Improving safety features can significantly boost car acceptability.**  

---

### **3️⃣ Car Acceptability by Maintenance Cost**  
📌 **Maintenance costs impact car classification:**  
- **High maintenance cost = Mostly Unacceptable Cars.**  
- **Low maintenance cost = Better acceptability.**  
💰 **Business Insight:** Reducing **maintenance costs** can **increase market acceptance**.  

---

### **4️⃣ Car Acceptability by Number of Doors**  
📌 **Does the number of doors impact acceptability?**  
- **Minimal effect on car classification.**  
- **4+ door cars** show slightly **better acceptability.**  
📌 **Conclusion:** Buyers may prioritize other factors like **safety and maintenance** over the number of doors.  

---

### **5️⃣ Car Acceptability by Passenger Capacity (Bar Chart)**  
📌 **Does passenger capacity affect acceptability?**  
- **Two-person cars are mostly "Unacceptable."**  
- **Cars that accommodate 4+ passengers tend to be more "Acceptable."**  
🏡 **Business Application:** Larger **family cars have higher market demand.**  

---

### **6️⃣ Car Acceptability by Luggage Boot Space**  
📌 **Storage capacity matters to buyers:**  
- **Small luggage space = High "Unacceptable" rating.**  
- **Bigger luggage space = Higher acceptability.**  
🛒 **Takeaway:** **Storage space is an important factor in car acceptability.**  

---

## **📌 Conclusion & Business Insights**  

✅ **Safety and maintenance cost** are the **most important factors**—improving these can **increase acceptability.**  
✅ **Passenger capacity and luggage space matter**—larger cars with **more storage perform better** in evaluations.  
✅ **Most cars fail to meet acceptability criteria**—indicating a **high bar for quality standards.**  
✅ **Door count has a lower impact** compared to other features like **safety and maintenance.**  

### **🚀 How This Helps Stakeholders:**  
✔ **Car Manufacturers** – Focus on **safety, affordability, and space** to improve ratings.  
✔ **Dealerships** – Promote **family-friendly and low-maintenance cars** for better sales.  
✔ **Customers** – Consider **safety, maintenance, and storage capacity** as key purchase factors.
